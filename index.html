    <p>Samwell is a steward in the Night's Watch and is Jon Snow's closest friend. He is the eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly and Lady Melessa Tarly of Horn Hill. Though he is overweight and not the bravest or most skilled of men, he is intelligent, well-educated, and insightful, his vast knowledge serves the Night's Watch well in their battles with the forces beyond the Wall.<br><i>Taken from the Game of Thrones Wiki. <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Samwell_Tarly">See full page.</a></i>
